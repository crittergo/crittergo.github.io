Rats are one of the more atypical but neat small rodents that you can have as a pet. They are perfect for young children, and they come in a wide variety of color coats and temperaments. Typically, they live for between one and a half to two and a half years if they are cared for well.

## Shelter

Like most other small rodents, rats are very social creatures. You should consider having at least two rats at any given time to prevent loneliness. When it comes to providing a living area for your rats, they should have a medium to large cage with bedding made from recycled paper or wood 
chips that are not pine or cedar.

## Diet

Rats have a rather specialized diet that needs to be high in protein. There are “rat blocks” that are sold by various pet care companies that provide high protein as well as a large amount of vitamins and nutrients that will keep your rat healthy.

## Activity/Exercise

You should make sure that your rat has ample place to run around so that they do not become bored and lethargic. They enjoy playing with toys and 
tunneling in their bedding. You should also consider giving your rat man-made tunnels that they can use to avoid direct light.

## Health

One of the biggest dangers to the health of a rat is a cold. They are susceptible to them and if left untreated, they can be fatal. On the other end of the spectrum, rats are likely to be harmed by excessive amounts of heat, and should be kept in a moderately temperate room. If your rat becomes unusually lethargic, they should be examined by a vet, though there is not a great deal that they can do to treat an injured animal of this size.Rats require hard chewing blocks in order to keep their teeth from growing 
too large or creating dental problems.

## Grooming

While rats are small, and consequently so are their droppings, they need to have their cage or living space cleaned weekly. This will prevent diseases spreading between the two rats and allow them to live comfortably and cleanly.
