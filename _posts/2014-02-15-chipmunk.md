Siberian chipmunks are fun, active critters that can be a bit of a handful to raise because of their high energy. They are small, typically between five and six inches in length, and only weigh about 2-3 ounces. Despite their small size and active lifestyle, Siberian chipmunks can live for up to ten years if they are treated properly.

## Shelter

The housing for a Siberian chipmunk is one of the more complicated facets of owning a chipmunk. They should have a multi-level wire cage. The bars should be less than a half inch apart to prevent them from escaping from the habitat.
While they are small animals, the cage should measure 12x24x18 inches at minimum. This will allow them to have plenty of room to run around, especially considering that it is not recommended that you allow them to run around your home. 

Another neat idea for a chipmunk housing unit is to build a small wooden enclosure that is about the size of a birdhouse: 6x6x8 inches for example. This will give them the sense of being in an outdoors area while providing a dark place within their cage.The bedding in their habitat should consist of a thick assortment of wood chips that can be burrowed in while providing a soft landing area for when 
they tumble.

## Diet

The main part of a Siberian chipmunkâ€™s diet should consist of rodent diet pellets that are high in fiber and protein. Chipmunks should also be fed a large assortment of vegetables, fruits, and nuts such as pecans, peanuts, apples, grapes, and broccoli. Siberian chipmunks require fresh water to be added to their bottle daily. This should be cleaned at least once every two weeks with a pipe brush and hot water.

## Activity/Exercise 

For the most part, Siberian chipmunks will be able to get as much exercise as they need in their cage as long as you provide them with a wheel and a large enough cage. You should also purchase several toys to keep your chipmunk engaged and playful such as logs and balls that they can roll through their bedding.

## Health

One of the health concerns for Siberian chipmunks is the length of their nails. You should take your chipmunk to a vet at least once a year, and during that time they should have their nails trimmed to an acceptable level.Another consideration for Siberian chipmunk health is oral care. You should provide plenty of chewing toys so that they can cull their teeth, which will prevent oral decay and a variety of other ailments. You should watch for signs of a cold such as runny eyes and coughing. This can lead to complications of the respiratory system, which is one of the leading causes of death in chipmunks besides old age.

## Grooming

You can give a Siberian chipmunk a sponge bath if they become too dirty from walking through soiled bedding. Use only warm water and be extremely gentle. You should change the bedding of the cage once a week and clean the bottom of the cage at the same time. To do this, you should use only hot water and a scrub brush so that there are no adverse reactions to cleaning chemicals. By following these simple tips, you can extend the life of your Siberian chipmunk by years.
