One of the most loving and rewarding pets that you can own is a Guinea Pig. They are quiet, easy to care for, and can provide companionship for many years.

## Shelter

The primary shelter that you can provide for a Guinea Pig is a large cage with soft bedding. However, many pet owners prefer to let their Guinea Pigs roam around their home, either freely or inside a play ball. Certain precautions must be taken to ensure that your pet does not wander into any hazardous areas.

## Diet

While you will primarily feed a Guinea Pig manufactured food, you can always supplement their diet with vegetables such as carrots to make sure that they receive the proper amount of nutrients and vitamins to allow them to live a long, healthy life. One of the treats that you can feed Guinea Pigs is timothy hay, a healthy grass that allows them to keep their teeth healthy.

## Activity/Exercise

Most Guinea Pigs will spend the majority of their day in an area of the cage that is out of direct sight. Some Guinea Pigs will remain nocturnal when you keep them and should be given a dark shelter. For this reason you need to make sure that you pay attention to when your pet is most active, and allow them to wander out of the cage freely under supervision, or inside a ball.

## Health

Like most other small animals, you need to make sure that your Guinea Pig is drinking sufficient amounts of water. This is most noticeable in their droppings, which should be small and relatively hard. If they experience wetness in their hindquarters or have any noticeable discharge, then they 
need to be taken to a vet immediately for examination.

## Grooming

Cleaning a Guinea Pigâ€™s fur is simple because they enjoy water, for the most part. However, this is discouraged in the winter or in a cold environment. They must be bathed in warm water to regulate their body temperature. Also, since they frequently defecate, it is smart to clean their cage or primary area before you can smell it. Try not to put a clean Guinea Pig into a dirty area.
