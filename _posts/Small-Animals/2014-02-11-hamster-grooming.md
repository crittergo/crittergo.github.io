## Grooming

Your hamster cage will require touching up or bedding replacement. If you notice stronger odors, consider cleaning more frequently. 
Unless your hamster has something sticky in its fur, it should never have a bath in water. Fill a small bowl with chinchilla bath sand made from volcanic ash and place it in the cage. The hamster will instinctively roll around in it to clean itself off. Make sure that the sand you purchase is dust-free to prevent respiratory issues.
