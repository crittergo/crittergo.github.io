Sugar gliders are an exotic pet that can be rather difficult, yet rewarding to own. They have some particular needs, but are relatively easy to care for if you know some basic information. They can be your companions for about twelve to fifteen years.

##Shelter

In order to successfully house a sugar glider you will need a rather large cage. At the bare minimum, they need a cage that is 30x18x36 inches in size; the taller the better. They need ample room to jump and glide in order to be happy.The bottom of their cage needs to be covered in wood chips or similar soft bedding to catch droppings and keep the cage dry. The best type of bedding for sugar gliders is pine chips, for its pleasant aroma and easiness to clean.

##Diet

Sugar gliders enjoy a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables to provide them with all of the energy that they need to be active. In particular, you should treat them to citrus fruits, bananas, softened carrots, and bits of corn. They also require a high amount of protein in their diet that can be fulfilled by crickets, dry pellets, or even turkey food.

##Activity/Exercise 

The best part about sugar gliders is that they are so naturally active that you do not need to be an active part in their exercise. They run, jump, and glide all on their own. They just need the amount of required space in order to perform these activities.

##Health

Since they are naturally nocturnal animals, if you notice that they are not active during the night or especially active during the day, you should have them examined by a veterinarian. They are companionate animals that need to have attention from their owner in order to remain healthy. Otherwise, they can become sulky and withdrawn, which can have physical symptoms. One of the biggest dangers for sugar gliders is the flight membrane from their wrist to their ankles. It can become damaged or torn during activities, and while this is rare, it requires immediate attention from a professional.

##Grooming

Since they can be somewhat messy when it comes to their droppings, you will need to clean their cage completely twice a week. This involves using a bleach and water mixture to clean every level of the multi-tiered cage to remove feces and urine from the bars where they tend to sit. When the bedding is removed, clean the bottom of the cage with a Â½ cup to 1 gallon ratio of bleach and water using a scrubbing brush. Rinse it completely before adding more bedding chips.
