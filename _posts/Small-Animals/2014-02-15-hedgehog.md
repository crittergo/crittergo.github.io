Hedgehogs are relatively small, insect-eating rodents that can make great pets if they have a dedicated owner. While many people will be turned away by the presence of their quills, hedgehogs are able to be petted safely, without any risk of injury to you or them.

## Shelter

The shelter that you need to provide for your hedgehog will need to be very large to accommodate their active lifestyle. You should have a multi-tiered cage that has a two square feet base and at least two feet high. They require a great deal of space to move about. The bottom of their cage, usually a wire cage, should not be covered solely by wood chip bedding. They should have some sort of loose cloth such as fleece that they can wrap themselves in if they feel cold, as they are very sensitive to changes in temperature. For the most part, hedgehogs do not like to share their habitat with other hedgehogs and should be kept as solo pets.

## Diet

Hedgehogs have unusual dietary requirements that must be met if they are to live a healthy life. While they can be fed dry cat food with a high protein and vitamin D content, they can also subsist on freeze-dried beetles. Make sure the food bowl is wide enough that the hedgehog will not turn it over while they are attempting to eat. Pet shops carry ceramic bowls that are extra wide and have a firm base that are perfect for 
hedgehogs.

## Activity/Exercise 

For the most part, you can allow your hedgehog out of its cage to get To help them get exercise, you can use pet barriers to block off a room so exercise in a safe indoor area. They usually do not like to be placed into balls, depending on their temperament, and they prefer open spaces to their cage, no matter how large it may be, that they can frolic safely.

## Health

Perhaps the most unique problem facing hedgehogs is obesity. You must make sure that they have adequate space to move around in the cage. Also, you must be sure that you regulate their diet so that they do not eat too much food. If your hedgehog is unable to fold into a ball, then you should consult a veterinarian.

## Grooming

Like any other pet, you should change the bedding in your hedgehogâ€™s cage every week. Since they prefer cloth material, you should clean any droppings out of the cage daily, and be prepared to change the bedding at any time. You can wash the fleece in a washing machine or by hand, using only dish soap and hot water to prevent skin irritation. When it comes to cleaning the base of the cage, you should use hot water and dish soap in conjunction with a scrubbing brush for maximum cleanliness.
