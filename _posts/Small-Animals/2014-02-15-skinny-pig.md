Skinny pigs are a cousin of the cute and familiar guinea pig. They are similar in terms of temperament and sociability, but they do require a bit 
more care due to the fact that they are, for the most part, hairless.

##Shelter

Sheltering a skinny pig is simple. They should be placed in a wire cage that has plenty of room for them to run around to cut down on the risk of obesity. Typically, these cages should be a minimum of 30x 18x 20 inches. 
The bottom of the cage should be coated in soft bedded pine chips, with a layer of fleece on the bottom of the cage to provide extra warmth.

##Diet
Skinny pigs enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, peppers, and zucchini.The majority of a skinny pig’s diet should consist of vitamin and protein fortified pellets that are marketed specifically for guinea pigs and skinny pigs. Skinny pigs should also be offered timothy hay to keep their teeth strong and provide supplemental vitamins for gastrointestinal health.

##Activity/Exercise 

Since skinny pigs are typically more active during dusk and night hours, by having a large cage you can ensure that they are going to get as much exercise as they need. Skinny pigs can also be placed into a small rodent ball and allowed to roam around a safe area indoors. Typically, you would use a ball with a 10-12 inch circumference.
You can also allow your companion to roam around freely in a restricted, safe area. This can be accomplished by creating a safe zone using pet barriers that are marketed for small dogs.

##Health

One of the biggest problems that face skinny pigs in terms of their health is that they are more susceptible to cuts and scrapes due to having little to no fur. Pay attention for cuts and abrasions and do not be afraid to consult a veterinarian if you are unsure of how to handle these situations.
Another common ailment to all small rodents is the overgrowth of their teeth. In order to combat this occurrence, you should give your skinny pig a chew toy or a log so that they can cull their teeth.

##Grooming

You should clean the bedding of your skinny pig’s habitat daily by removing all droppings and wet bedding. Each week you should completely change the bedding, and clean the bottom of the cage with a mixture of hot water and bleach. You can also use a small paint scraper to remove any droppings or bedding that is stuck to the bottom of the cage.Many skinny pigs enjoy the water, and can benefit greatly from a simple bath. However, you must be sure that their body temperature does not drop too low or they can become very ill. Make sure to have towels ready to warm your skinny pig after it has been cleaned, and then take it to a warm area before putting it back in the cage. If your skinny pig is able to hold still, you can use a hair dryer on a low setting to warm them up again.
