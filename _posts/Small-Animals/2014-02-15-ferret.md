Ferrets are some of the most beautiful and interesting small, domesticated rodents. They come in a wide variety of colors including brown, red, white, and gold. They typically live between six and eight years, and require a bit of special care.

## Shelter

Since ferrets are some of the most active and playful small rodents, they need a great deal of space to move around. As such, they should not be caged for long periods of time, and when they are, they need a cage that has plenty of tubes and hiding spaces to keep themselves entertained.

## Diet

Since ferrets are some of the most active and playful small rodents, they need a great deal of space to move around. As such, they should not be caged for long periods of time, and when they are, they need a cage that has plenty of tubes and hiding spaces to keep themselves entertained.

## Activity/Exercise

Ferrets are one of the most playful small rodents. They need to have a great deal of time to run around every day or they will get restless and start chewing on anything that they can find. This can cause injuries and aggravation. So, it is important to have a small rodent ball that you can put your ferret into so that they can roll around safely.

## Health

The most dangerous illness that can face a ferret is intestinal obstruction. This happens when they chew on soft plastic pieces such as their food bowl, and swallow it, creating a blockage that is often fatal. Also, you may want to consider de-scenting your ferret for practical reasons, unless you are breeding your ferret.

## Grooming

You should change your ferretâ€™s bedding completely at least once a week, with daily removals of wet or messy bedding. Also, it is possible to litter train ferrets since they are such intelligent animals. Not only will this give them a cleaner habitat, but it will ensure that they live a longer, healthier life. Not to mention, it is a neat trick that you can show your friends and family.
