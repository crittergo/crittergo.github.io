One of the most fun and unique animals that you can have as a pet is a prairie dog. While they are small, only about the size of a large squirrel, they are incredibly hardy animals with an average lifespan between ten and twelve years.

##Shelter

The shelter that you will want to use to house your prairie dog is a multi-level ferret cage. These tend to be up to three feet tall with base dimensions of two feet by two feet. You will want to use a wife mesh cage to ensure that they will not escape easily, as they are very capable escape artists.
You should cover the bottom of the cage in hay or pine shavings so that 
moisture can be absorbed, and also so that the prairie dog can create a burrow. 
Speaking of burrows and nests, prairie dogs can get bored of a single housing, so you should consider having a spare cage or open area in your home where you can let it roam freely.

##Diet

The main diet of a prairie dog should consist of a mixture of hay and specially formulated rodent blocks that can be found in any pet store. 
In order to supplement their vitamins and nutrients, you should also feed your prairie dog a variety of fruits and vegetables along with an ample supply of water inside of a feeder bottle.

##Activity/Exercise 

Exercise is very important to prairie dogs since their metabolism is only about half of that of other small rodents such as guinea pigs and chinchillas. This is one of the reasons that they are so hardy; they store energy well and use it sparingly.
You can encourage your prairie dog to be active by keeping it stimulated. Give it plenty of toy balls in their cage, and be sure to let them out if the environment allows. Also, provide a means for them to burrow, after all it comes naturally to them and is a great source of exercise.

##Health

One of biggest health problems that can occur in Prairie dogs is obesity. Since their metabolism is slow, they burn energy slowly. Therefore, you should make sure not to overfeed your prairie dog not matter how much it will beg you.

When it comes to the social health of your prairie dog, you should be sure to initiate bonding with them as soon as you bring them home. This can bedone by holding them for twenty minutes at a time, so they accept you as a companion as well as an authority figure. This will prevent malcontent throughout their lives.

##Grooming

Basic grooming of your prairie dog can be done by washing them in a tub with tepid water and baby shampoo. This will clean their fur of droppings which tend to stick to them when they burrow in their own mess. You should clean the bedding out of the cage every week while cleaning the bottom of the cage with hot water only. Prairie dogs have a tendency to be very sensitive to small amounts of chemicals.
