Raccoons are one of the most charming animals that you will have a chance to own. The term “chance” is important here, as some places require you to have a permit to own a raccoon. They are intelligent, loyal pets, but also have a tendency to be destructive.

##Shelter

When it comes to providing shelter for a raccoon, you should be aware that they are free-roaming animals that do not like to be placed into cages. They are hardy animals and are about as likely to be injured by their environment as a cat or dog. They will roam around your home, but should be given some space that they can hide in during their sleeping hours.
You can also consider putting your raccoon in an outside pen. If you choose to put them in an outside pen, then it should be no smaller than a 7 foot square base with height of five feet. You should construct the pen out of chicken wire or similar metal mesh that would be difficult for them to chew through. However, it is usually not a good idea to switch them between inside and outside pets as it will affect their domesticity.

##Diet

The best way to feed a raccoon, since they are not typical pets, is to give them a mixture of dry dog food as well as wet cat food. This should be mixed at a 1cup to ¼ can ratio.
Raccoons also enjoy fish and various types of vegetables such as zucchini, carrots, and celery. These dietary modifications will give them a boost of fiber that will help their digestive tract while providing them with a break from the monotony of kibble foods.

##Activity/Exercise 

Your raccoon will be able to get as much exercise as it needs by running around your home. However, be forewarned that these animals tend to get into mischief during their adventures around their habitat and have been known to chew and shred household rugs and furniture.

##Health

All raccoons that are made to be pets should be spayed or neutered not long after they are brought home. However, one of the greatest difficulties associated with a raccoon is the fact that there are few veterinarians that will treat raccoons for legal and safety reasons. Be sure to find and consult a veterinarian in your area before you bring home a raccoon. Another consideration for the health of your raccoon is their teeth. While they do not need to cull them like a rat or guinea pig, raccoons need to have a diet that is rich in calcium to fortify their teeth.

##Grooming

One of the best parts about owning a raccoon is that they can be house- broken and trained to use a litter box like a cat. You can use a cat’s litter box for a raccoon, as well as cat litter which requires weekly cleaning at the minimum. Also, you should clean the base of the litter box once a week with a mixture of half a cup of bleach to one gallon of water to kill germs and bacteria.
Raccoons love being in and around water, so they can be bathed regularly for fun and for hygiene. You can wash them in warm water using baby shampoo to clean their fur. For the most part raccoons will be complacent in water and allow you to easily clean them.
