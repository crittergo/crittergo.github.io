Short-tailed possums are famous for being one of the few truly insectivorous animals in the Americas. They are small, only three to six inches in length, and they do not have a pouch like most other marsupials. They are usually nocturnal, and can survive as your companion for up to five years.

##Shelter

One of the most important things to consider when raising a short-tailed possum is that they are solitary animals and should not be placed into a habitat with another animal.Typically, the best shelter for a short-tailed possum is a ten or twenty gallon aquarium with a mesh metal ceiling. This allows for good air circulation and all but removes the possibility that they will be able to escape. 

The bottom of the aquarium should be lined with soft wooden bedding such as aspen bedding or pine shavings. You should place a six inch circumference igloo or wooden box in the habitat so that the short-tailed possum can hide from the light during the daytime hours. Also, you should regulate the temperature in their enclosure between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit to keep their body heat at acceptable levels.

##Diet

Since they are insectivores, you will need to provide your short-tailed possum with live crickets and mealworms for them to feed upon. 
You can also feed them soft foods that are made for ferrets. Short-tailed possums also enjoy eating ripe fruits such as apples, oranges, and grapes, though you should only feed it to them sparingly; once a week.

##Activity/Exercise 

When it comes to exercise, the habitat should provide adequate space for the short-tailed possum to run around. However, they should be offered tubes made from PVC pipe or a similar material so that they can mimic the actions of moving through tunnels. It is not recommended to allow short-tailed possums to roam freely around the house at any time because they can easily become lost of squeeze into areas where they are difficult to safely retrieve.

##Health

One of the health concerns for short-tailed possums is their tails which are prehensile, but also prone to being injured by rubbing or chaffing.
In terms of their social health, your short-tailed possum should be allowed to climb on you to become accustomed to your scent so that they recognize you as a friend and companion. Like other small rodents, the respiratory system of short-tailed possums is very delicate, meaning that they should not be subjected to humid or cold areas.

##Grooming

While it is possible to bathe your short-tailed possum by hand, it is not recommended unless they have visible filth on their body because their lack of thick body hair makes them lose body heat quickly. If you must bathe your short-tailed possum, be sure to use a warm sponge and spend no more than five minutes cleaning your pet. When it comes to cleaning the habitat of the short-tailed possum, you should change the bedding every week and be sure to scrub the bottom of the aquarium with hot water. Also, be sure to clean your petâ€™s igloo and PVC tunnels every other week using nothing but hot water and a pipe cleaner. Short-tailed possums are very neat pets, and limit their waste to a single portion of their overall habitat.
