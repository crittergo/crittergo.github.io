Chinchillas are a medium-sized rodent, between ten and twelve inches in length, and are famous for their love of burrowing and hiding in their habitats. They make great pets because they are soft, social, and rarely bite. Aside from their beauty, they can live as long as twenty years if they receive the right kind of care.

##Shelter

The shelter that you are going to want to give your chinchilla is similar to other small rodents in the sense that you should provide a wire cage with a plastic basin. However, it must be larger than the typical rodent cage and should measure somewhere around 2 feet by 1 ½ feet by 2 feet. They need a cage where they can have room to run, jump, and hide themselves as well as their toys. Like other small animals, they benefit from having bedding such as pine chips on the bottom of their cage to catch waste and soften their landings.

##Diet

You can feed chinchillas a blend of pellets specially made for chinchillas that is sold in any pet store. Also, chinchillas enjoy timothy hay and other small animal-safe grasses. It is important to keep a feeder of fresh, temperate water in their cage at all times. Chinchillas need to drink frequently, and should have their bottles cleaned regularly. You can clean their bottles by using hot water and a small amount of dish soap.

##Activity/Exercise 

Since chinchillas tend to become very attached to their owners or other chinchillas in their habitat, you should dedicate time every day to interacting and playing with your chinchilla. They are fragile animals, but they enjoy running, climbing, and jumping.You can put your chinchilla in a small rodent ball, one foot in circumference, and allow them to roam around a safe area. Chinchillas can also roam freely, but you must be sure that the area is devoid of cubbies or other areas where they can become lost or trapped. You can buy several mesh gates that will allow you to cordon off a room 
for your chinchilla to use.

##Health

If they are cared for properly, chinchillas can live an incredibly long life for a rodent. This requires a yearly checkup with a veterinarian to look for any possible anomalies. One of the most common injuries that chinchillas can suffer is a broken bone in their back foot that can result from rough play or fighting with other chinchillas. By keeping a thick layer of soft bedding, you can reduce the risk of this happening. Another consideration for chinchillas’ health is gastrointestinal problems that can result from an improper diet. If your chinchilla seems unusually lethargic or is laying down much more than usual, they should be taken to a vet immediately.

##Grooming

One of the most important things that you can do for your chinchilla is to give them a clean environment. Make sure that you remove droppings and wet bedding daily, and completely replace the bedding once every week. It is important to clean the bottom of the basin out using hot water and hypoallergenic dish soap such as Dawn that will not provoke adverse skin reactions. Use a scrub brush to get a complete cleaning experience. You can give your chinchilla a bath if they begin to smell badly, but be sure to use temperate water rather than hot or cold water because they are very sensitive to changes in temperature. To bathe them, use a small amount of water and consider putting your chinchilla in a colander or sieve.
