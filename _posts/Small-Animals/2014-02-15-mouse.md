Mice are a nice starter pet for anyone looking for a small companion. They are small, easy to care for, and can be very social or independent pets. Mice are also fragile, and must be treated carefully when they are handled.

##Shelter

Like rats and other small animals, mice are very social within their own species, so it is not a bad idea to keep more than one mouse at a time. You can keep mice in a small, ten gallon glass aquarium with a wire mesh roof. They do not require the extensive air flow that other small rodentsneed, and the glass will prevent them from gnawing on a wire cage.

##Diet

Mice can typically subsist on commercial mouse pellets, but make sure that they have a good source of natural protein.You can also feed your mouse some fruit and vegetables in small amounts such as peas, carrots, and bananas.

##Activity/Exercise 

Inside of their aquarium, mice will be able to get adequate exercise. However, you should consider getting them some tubes to run though for entertainment purposes. If you hand-tame your mouse, you can allow them to run around a small, enclosed area in your home.

##Health

One of the health issues that are common to mice is their teeth overgrowing. You must provide a chewing block or toy so that they can keep their teeth healthy and culled. Mice are susceptible to lice and other skin parasites. If you suspect that they are infested, take them to a veterinarian immediately.

##Grooming

While you can brush their hair, most mice will not sit still long enough until they are trained. When you are handling your mouse, you must be careful not to grab them by the end of their tail to avoid injury. Mice are fragile, so be sure to supervise any children that are going to handle them.
