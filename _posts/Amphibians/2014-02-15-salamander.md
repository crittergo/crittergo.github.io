Salamanders are amphibians that usually range in length from a few 
inches up to several feet, though the average salamander is between 
four and eight inches long. They are famous for being able to regenerate 
damaged and missing limbs, to an extent, and for their lifespan of up to 
five years. 

## Shelter
Salamanders must be kept in an aquarium, ten gallons is sufficient, 
because they require a moist environment. You should keep your 
salamander’s habitat between 65 and 75 degrees; room temperature. Be 
careful during the summer to make sure that the habitat is kept cool and 
out of direct sunlight.

Salamanders need to be kept in a habitat that has ample places to hide 
in darkness. This can be accomplished by adding artificial hollow logs, 
sticks, and vegetation which can all be purchased at a pet store or even 
a reptile and amphibian specialty store.

When it comes to covering the bottom of the habitat, you should cover 
the floor with moss, potting compost, and bark chips to make it soft and 
similar to a salamander’s natural environment. 

You need to place a pond in the habitat so that the salamander can 
remain moist and cool. You can purchase a porcelain bath from any pet 
store, but you must make sure that it is large enough to accommodate 
your salamander’s body.


## Diet
You must keep in mind that salamanders are nocturnal, so you should 
typically feed them during nighttime hours. 

Salamanders are carnivorous and should be fed earthworms, slugs, 
woodlice, or crickets. You can purchase these in a pet store, but they are 
usually free-dried. If you want fresh ones, then you should find a local 
reptile and amphibian pet store.


## Activity/Exercise
Salamanders will get plenty of exercise inside of their habitat by running 
through the different obstacles that you place inside. They will also climb 
around the glass on the aquarium, but they will rarely try to escape.


## Health
While you may be tempted to handle your salamander often, after all it is 
your pet and companion, you should actually handle them as little as 
possible. The salts and oils on your flesh are absorbed through their 
skin, and since they are such small creatures it can be harmful to their 
skin.


## Grooming
You must clean your salamander’s habitat every two to three months. 
They are not very messy creatures so if you are vigilant about removing 
their droppings, you do not need to clean often.

When you clean the habitat, you should clean the glass with a mixture 
of warm, soapy water. You need to completely rinse all of the obstacles 
in the tank for cleaning, and you must completely replace the bottom 
mixture of moss or wood shavings.

You should clean the porcelain pond with hot water only, so that their 
bodies are not dried out by any remaining soap when it is finished.
