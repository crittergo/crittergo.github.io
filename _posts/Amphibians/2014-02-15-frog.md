Terrestrial frogs, land dwellers, are the type of frog that is easiest to 
raise, and are the best type of frog for those who have never cared for 
an amphibian before. For those who enjoy these spunky critters, you will 
be happy to know that the average terrestrial frog in captivity lives for ten 
to twelve years.


## Shelter
One of the most important aspects of caring for a terrestrial frog is the 
habitat that you provide. If you get your frog young, then you can put it 
into a 5 gallon aquarium and then move it to a 10 gallon aquarium as it 
grows. Feel free to begin with the 10 gallon aquarium if you have one 
available. Be sure to place a wire screen over the top of the aquarium, 
because they can and will jump out of the habitat.
 
You will need to provide a UV light for your frog, since they will not be 
sunning outside. This will mimic the natural sunlight, providing them with 
warmth while stimulating their bodies.
 
You should put a small amount of sticks and hollow logs into the habitat 
to give your frog a place to hide, climb and sleep. The bottom of the 
habitat should be covered in a smooth gravel mixture that can be found 
in any pet store.


## Diet
Since there is no ìFrog foodî for sale, you need to pay close attention to 
your frogís diet. Terrestrial frogs prefer live food such as crickets or 
mealworms. You can buy these at any pet store.
 
When it comes to feeding your frog, you must understand that they do 
not need to be fed every day. Some days they may eat one or more 
crickets a day, and other days they will just not be interested in eating.
 
You need to provide a fresh pond of water for your frog to "drink". They 
will sit in the water pond, so you need to make sure that the pond is 
almost as wide as your frog. If you are feeling unsure, consult a worker 
at a pet store and they can recommend a pond for your frog.


## Activity/Exercise
 
 For the most part, frogs will get all of the exercise that they need inside 
of their habitat, but that does not mean that you cannot or should not 
take them out of their cage. However, you must be careful when you 
remove your frog from their habitat because they are tricky to catch once 
they get loose. Make sure that you can limit their area of movement in a 
small room, and let them loose, under close supervision, once or twice a 
week.



## Health
 
The primary health concern for terrestrial frogs is that they can carry 
diseases home from the pet store and possibly infect other members of 
their living area. Since frogs are tough creatures, do not expect them to 
ìshowî when they are becoming ill. Typically, when frogs show that they 
are ill, they are already sick and tend to have a fast downturn.
 
You need to check around your area to see if there are any 
veterinarians that will take care of frogs, since they are considered 
exotic. You need to know where you can go if your friend becomes ill.


## Grooming
Cleaning the habitat is both important and somewhat difficult. After all, a 
wet area is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria that can make your 
frog ill. 
 
Clean the water pond every other day, no exceptions. Clean the bottom 
of the pond with hot water only because chemicals left over will be 
absorbed through the skin.
 
Cleaning the stone can be done in the same way; use boiling water to 
clean the rocks once a week and then change the rocks completely once 
a month. Also, change the sticks and logs once a month, or buy artificial 
ones and clean them once a month using the same method as cleaning 
the stones, with boiling water.
