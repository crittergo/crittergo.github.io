Alpine Newts are a cousin to salamanders and have unique care requirements. They are one of the most often purchased species of newts, and they are home to the western European forests, which have allowed them to withstand cooler temperatures than most other species. If cared for properly, you can expect your friend to grow to five inches in length, and to live for between fifteen and twenty years.


## Shelter
Newts enjoy scurrying through their habitat, and therefore require a large amount of space. You should purchase a twenty gallon aquarium so that they 
have plenty of area to explore in their habitat.

Like other amphibians, you need to regulate the temperature in the aquarium so that it is somewhere between 55 and 70 degrees. If they are placed in a colder area of the home, then you should purchase a heating pad to place under the tank as well as a thermometer to check the temperature.

The bottom of the tank needs to be covered in at least a foot and half of water so that your newt can swim. On one side of the tank you need to build a 
terrestrial habitat consisting of stones, moss, and artificial logs and sticks. Make sure to fill the tank with de-chlorinated water or purchase de-chlorinating drops. You will also need ph testing strips to ensure that the water is between 6.4 and 7.8 ph.


## Diet
Feeding an Alpine newt is rather simple as they are carnivorous. You should purchase worms and crickets to feed it. However, it you have a young newt that still only lives in the aquatic section of the habitat, then you should purchase brine shrimp and bloodworms to feed your Alpine newt.

## Activity/Exercise
Between swimming and climbing through their terrestrial habitat, your new will get plenty of exercise. It is not advised for you to remove them from their habitat for more than a few minutes at a time.


## Health
Like other aquatic and semi-aquatic animals, alpine newts are susceptible to water-borne bacteria and can get infections that affect their skin. You must change the water any time that it becomes cloudy, and then often even when it is not. 

You should find an exotic pet veterinarian that can treat your alpine newt if it becomes ill. Most typical vets will not be equipped to care for amphibians and reptiles, especially since they tend to “crash” quickly after they show symptoms.


## Grooming
You should have a water filter for your tank that runs constantly in order to clean the water and aerate it. This will keep the water from becoming “stale”, and will help regulate the ph level.

You should completely clean the habitat once every two to three months. This involves cleaning the class with hot water only, no soap or anything else that will throw off the ph balance.

You should change the rocks, moss, and other obstacles every two to three months as well, so that you do not cross contaminate the habitats. Also, if you use a specific brand of spring water to fill the aquarium, be sure to use that brand when you refill the tank.
