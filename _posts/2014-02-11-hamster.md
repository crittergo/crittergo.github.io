If you’re looking to own a small pet, a hamster is a good place to start. They require minimal care when in a comfortable environment. They are nocturnal and prefer to live alone. 

## Shelter

There are many styles of shelter for your hamster, from cages, aquariums, to intricate habitats with a number of tubes to crawl through. Once you’ve chosen the a type of housing, you will need to fill it with bedding to keep the environment dry and keep odor under control.  

## Diet

Store-bought hamster foods include a mixture of seeds and grains. For added variety, you can supplement with fresh nuts, fruits and vegetables a couple times a week. Avoid onions, candy, chocolate, large beans, rhubarb or raw potatoes. Always have have plenty of fresh water in a suspended rodent drinking bottle.

## Activity/Exercise

Hamsters like to burrow and exercise. A shelter with tubes and spaces to hide in and a wheel to run around will keep your hamster happy and healthy.

## Health

While hamsters are normally quite hardy, small injuries or illnesses can complicate quickly. If you find signs such as loss of appetite, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, wheezing, wetness around the tail, hair loss, or diarrhea you should consider a trip to the vet. 

## Grooming

Your hamster cage will require touching up or bedding replacement. If you notice stronger odors, consider cleaning more frequently. 
Unless your hamster has something sticky in its fur, it should never have a bath in water. Fill a small bowl with chinchilla bath sand made from volcanic ash and place it in the cage. The hamster will instinctively roll around in it to clean itself off. Make sure that the sand you purchase is dust-free to prevent respiratory issues.
