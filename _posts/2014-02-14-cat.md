A cat is a great option for anyone looking for a pet that is both fun and friendly, yet requires 
relatively low care. While cats certainly need love and attention, in addition to food, water, 
and their litter boxes regularly cleaned, they are also quite independent.

## Shelter

Cats do not require any specific types of shelter, though many cat owners purchase 
various “cat condos” or similar products that serve as a place for cats to nap and play. 
Such products often include a scratching component as well.

## Diet

Cats typically can be fed either wet or dry cat food, and should always have plenty of 
fresh water available. Cat treats can also be incorporated, though they should be limited 
to ensure your cat doesn’t gain too much weight.

## Activity/Exercise
Kittens are often full of energy and enjoy playing, and keeping plenty of toys available 
will ensure the cat does a lot of playing to burn off energy. Cats who spend time 
outdoors likely get more exercise than indoor cats. To ensure your cat stays healthy and 
doesn’t gain too much weight, do not overfeed and take time each day to play with your 
cat.

## Health

Cats are generally quite healthy, but be sure to check with a vet if you notice anything 

out of the ordinary. Hairballs can be a common problem,, but there are many products 

that can be purchased to avoid them. As cats age, there are several health problems 

that can take place, so pay special attention to aging cats.

## Grooming

Cats are fairly self-sufficient when it comes to grooming. Short haired cats require 

minimal grooming, though long haired cats can be brushed on occasions to reduce 

shedding. Brushing can also help lower the risk of your cat experiencing hairballs.
