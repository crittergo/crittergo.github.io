One of the cutest and most engaging small animals that you can 

own is a rabbit. Domesticated rabbits vary in looks and personality, 

each with their own benefits. 


## Shelter
Usually, you should keep your rabbit at home in a large, 
comfortable cage with a great deal of soft bedding for them to 
nuzzle. They should always be kept indoors, as they are social 
animals and can be literally driven to a heart attack if they see a 
predator coming.

## Diet

The majority of a domesticated rabbit’s diet should come from 

grasses and timothy hay. These nutritious grasses are crucial 

to keep your rabbit’s digestive system and teeth healthy. If you 

are raising your rabbit from a young age, then for the first year 

you should give them a great deal of fresh, plain rabbit pellets. 

It is also important to keep an ample supply of water in a dish 

or a feeder, depending on which one your rabbit prefers.

## Activity/Exercise

Your rabbit will need a large amount of space to run around and 

frolic, but again this needs to be indoors only. You need to rabbit-
proof the area to prevent them from chewing paper or electrical 

wires.

## Health

Even if you are keeping a single rabbit, then you should consider 

spaying and neutering them to prevent certain types of cancer from 

forming. Typically, you should take your rabbit for a checkup once 

every year. Like other small rodents, if you notice that your rabbit 

is not moving its bowels regularly, then you should take it to the 

vet immediately to check for obstruction. This is prevalent in small 

animals, like rabbits, that like to chew household materials.

## Grooming

You should remove all of the soiled bedding from your rabbit’s cage 

every single day, with a full cleaning occurring once a week. 


If you see your rabbit eating their own feces, do not be concerned. 

This is a normal activity that is used to help regulate their bowels.


Rabbits should be brushed often to help maintain their fur. When 

picking your rabbit up, support its rear as well as its head.
