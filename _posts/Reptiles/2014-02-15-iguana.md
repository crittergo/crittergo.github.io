Iguanas can be a fun and relatively low key pet option. However, they can also be fairly expensive, especially when buying initial supplies for the pet. Getting a new iguana can be very exciting, but it’s important to leave the iguana alone for a few weeks after brining it home, in order for it to adjust properly.

## Shelter

Iguanas should have a cage or other type of enclosure. Some iguana owners allow their iguanas to have free range of the home, but if this is your first time owning an iguana, it’s best to have it in a cage at first. Iguanas can grow very large, and the cage should be at least twice the length of the iguana, and owners may need to get a larger cage as the iguana grows. The cage should be lined with newspapers, paper towels, or carpet. There should also be climbing structures or shelves so the iguana can climb and explore. Iguana also needs to have regular exposure to natural sunlight in addition to a heat lamp.

## Diet
In addition to general iguana food that can be purchased at a pet store, iguanas also need fruits and vegetables. Iguanas should be fed at least once per day, and more for iguanas that have larger appetites. Fresh water should also be easily accessible, and you can spray water onto the iguana’s food in order to ensure it’s drinking enough.

## Activity/Exercise

Be sure not to handle the iguana during the first few weeks of having it. As the iguana gets used to his new surroundings, you can handle it more and more, and it will become more tame. Having it out of the cage, under close supervision, is alright once he’s gotten used to his home.

## Health

To keep the iguana healthy, regular cleaning is necessary. The iguana owner should also use antibacterial soap to thoroughly clean his or her hands after feeding or otherwise handling the iguana. The cage should be cleaned regularly, and the bedding should be removed. It’s a good idea to invest in a disinfectant that will sterilize the cage during regular cleanings. Remove the iguana while cleaning the cage. Regular cleaning will help avoid parasites and other diseases.

## Grooming
Generally, iguanas are fairly clean, but you should regularly give your iguana a bath to clean off food or feces on the animal. You can purchase a large tub to use for a bath, and it should be filled with warm water. Soap should never be used. The iguana cage should also be lightly sprayed with water from a spray bottle on a daily basis, to keep the habitat moist.
