Turtles may appear to be a relatively low key pet, but there are several factors to consider before adoption one. Turtles should, like other reptiles, carry salmonella, and should not be kept as pets with young children, seniors, or those especially susceptible for disease. Turtles can also live a very long time, which should be kept in mind when selecting a pet.

##Shelter

Turtles should be kept in a large tank, at least 30-40 gallons. There should be areas of water and land for the turtle to explore, and turtles should also have a heat lamp. The cage itself should be lined with bedding or other type of liner cage should also have some sort of shelter within the tank. 

##Diet

Turtles eat both protein and fruits and vegetables. Younger turtles need to be fed more frequently, at least every day, and older turtles can be fed 3-4 times each week. Turtles should be fed worms, slugs, or crickets in addition to fruits and vegetables. Turtles should also have fresh water at all times.
##Activity/Exercise 

Turtles typically keep to themselves and aren’t very active. In fact, it’s not a good idea to remove the turtle from her cage very much, as the rapid changes in temperature can be bad for her. Turtles typically hibernate for 10-20 weeks during the fall.

##Health

Having a healthy environment for a turtle is essential to keeping them healthy. Be sure to clean the cage regularly, and to find out the specific habitat requirements for your breed of turtle. It’s also important to be especially careful about the spread of salmonella with turtles, as the disease can also affect the turtles as well. Keeping the cage clean is the best way to prevent turtles from getting infected. To clean the cage, remove the liner and everything else, then fill the cage with warm water and a small amount of dishwashing detergent. It’s a good idea to use gloves, then scrub the cage thoroughly before rinsing it out and replacing the bedding and other components of the cage.

##Grooming

Grooming for turtles is minimal. If the turtle’s shell or body is dirty from something in the cage, you can assist with cleaning, but generally regularly cleaning of the cage will prevent this from being a problem.
