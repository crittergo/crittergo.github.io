Many people like the idea of a chameleon as a pet due to their ability to change colors. 
Chameleons are hardy, and don’t require a great deal of care. However, they aren’t 
particularly playful or cuddly, and they should not be handled regularly, so for pet owners 
who want more interaction, they aren’t the best choice.

## Shelter

Chameleons need fairly large aquariums that are well ventilated; ideally made out 
of screen as opposed to glass. The cage should be lined with a light bedding, like 
newspaper or paper towels. Things like sand or gravel are not good ideas, as the 
chameleons may eat it and have health problems. A heat lamp is also required for 
chameleons. It’s important for the cage to contain live plants, branches, and other 
similar item so the chameleons are able to climb and exercise.

## Diet

Chameleons can eat a wide range of different types of foods, from insects such as 
crickets or worms, to various plants, including lettuce, flowering plants, dandelion leaves, 
and carrots. Insects that are too large could be difficult to digest.

## Activity/Exercise
Chameleons can become stressed if they are handled too much. However, while 
cleaning the cage, owners can give chameleons time to explore and climb. A small, 
enclosed, alternate cage can be used to give the chameleon more space during 
cleaning.

## Health

Chameleons are prone to getting dehydrated, so it’s a good idea to regularly mist the 
cage with a water bottle to keep the enclosure moist. A dehydrated chameleon may 
have closed or sunken eyes. Be sure the chameleon is getting regular water. By misting 
regularly, you can ensure your chameleon has plenty of water, as misting allows for 
water droplets to form on the plants in the cage for the chameleon to drink. A clean 
spray bottle is the easiest way to keep water in the cage.

## Grooming

Chameleons do not require any significant cleaning or groom, and in fact, handling of 

chameleons should be limited. They are extremely low maintenance in this respect.
