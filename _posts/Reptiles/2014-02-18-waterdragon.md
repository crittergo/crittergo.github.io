Water dragons are unique and interesting reptiles to have as a pet, as they are bright green, with a very long tail. They are known to be able to run on their hind legs, and also are able to swim quite well. 

##Shelter

Water dragons are best kept one to a cage, though if the tank is large enough, more than one may be kept together. Owners should be careful when introducing more than one water dragon, though, as they may not get along will and get aggressive. It is very important to house them in a very large cage, at least five feet long, three feet deep, and four feet high. Water dragons also need a high humidity level in their enclosure. The tank should have a loose lining, and have various patches of rocks throughout the lining. The enclosure should also have a metal mesh cover with a heat lamp and UVB lighting. 

##Diet

Water dragons eat both meat and vegetables; be sure to feed them dark leafy vegetables such as broccoli, green beans, and parsley, in addition to fruits like kiwi and berries. The bulk of a water dragon's diets should be protein such as crickets, earthworms, or small goldfish. 

##Activity/Exercise 

Water dragons need a large cage in order to feel comfortable and to prevent them from trying to escape and injuring themselves by hitting their bodies against the cage. A large cage will ensure space to move around and get exercise. Not all water dragons enjoy being held, but owners can patiently work on handling in order to build the water dragon's comfort level. 

##Health

Water dragons that do not get enough regular heat are prone to respiratory infections, so it's important to make sure a water dragon's heat lamp works properly and the reptile is exposed to several hours of heat each day. Respiratory infections can be noticed by labored breathing or closed, crusty eyes. Water dragons with discoloration of their skin may suffer from skin infections which can be treated with various topical medications. 

##Grooming

Water dragons go through shedding in stages, and do not shed all of their skin at once. Shedding typically occurs every month or so, and the water dragon's skin should not be peeled off by the owner. It is important to keep the water dragon's cage moist and humid, especially during the shedding process.
