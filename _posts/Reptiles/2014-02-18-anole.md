Green anoles are one of the most common types of lizard to have as a pet. They're known for being able to change colors; from green to brown, though they are a different type of species than the chameleon. They make popular pets because they're fairly inexpensive and easy to care for.

##Shelter

Green anoles are fairly small and several can be kept in one aquarian, though having more than one male can result in fighting. A ten gallon terrarium is big enough for up to two green anoles, and a larger terrarium is needed for more. The terrarium needs to be lined with soil or peat moss, and should be kept warm and humid, with plants and branches for the lizards to crawl on. The habitat should also be misted with a spray bottle of water on a daily basis. 

##Diet

Green anoles generally eat insects, and can be fed live crickets or meal worms. These can be purchased live or frozen and stored for a long time. Green anoles should be fed twice per day. 

##Activity/Exercise 

Green anoles do not require extensive exercise, and generally large terrarium filled with branches and hideaways will provide the lizard with plenty of activity. Owners can get creative with what is placed in the cage. 

##Health

Green anoles are sometimes prone to get dehydrated. An anole that looks emaciated or has loose folds of skin may be dehydrated. Fight dehydration by keeping the cage well misted with a spray bottle, and take the anole to a vet if it doesn't improve. 

##Grooming

Green anoles will shed their skin; pet owners should not try to peel off the skin, and should instead make sure to keep the aquarium especially humid during the process by continuing to mist the cage twice/day. A "moist box" can also be purchased to aid in the shedding process; it's a small box full of moist terrarium moss.
