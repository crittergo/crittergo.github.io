As their name suggests, blue tongue skinks are known for their blue tongues. They're fairly social lizards, and many enjoy being held, making them an ideal reptile for someone looking to bond more with his or her pet. 

##Shelter

Blue tongue skinks live in the desert, so they need a drier habitat. It's best to only have one skink in a cage, as they can become territorial easily. The skink should be kept in a solid glass tank, at least 55 gallons in size. The tank also needs a mesh lid that fits snugly, with a heating lamp on top of the cover. The tank should be lined with something like newspaper or paper towels, and should also have some rocks or branches for the skink to climb on. 

##Diet

Blue tongue skinks should be fed a great deal of vegetables such as red tip lettuce, clover, green beans, peas, and carrots. Owners can also feed apples, berries, and melons regularly. Insects can be fed regularly as well, including mealworms, cockroaches, and crickets. It's important to purchase insects from a regular reptile food supplier, as wild insects can carry disease. 

##Activity/Exercise 

Blue tongue skinks do not need ample exercise, though they tend to be quite social. Skink owners should be sure to wash their hands before and after handling, but can regularly handle the skink to ensure activity and stimulation. 

##Health

Blue tongue skinks can occasionally get various parasites, and signs of parasites include loss of appetite and abnormal stools. Skinks that show signs of parasites should be taken to a reptile vet for proper medication. It is also important to have a good heat lamp that supplies UV light in order to prevent respiratory diseases. Not getting proper heat and light can also cause skinks to have problems digesting their food. 

##Grooming

Skink owners should soak their skinks once every week. To do so, owners should use a large tupperware or similar container with water deep enough for the skink to be fully submerged, with its head above ground. The lizard should be allowed to stay in the water for around thirty minutes. Regular soaking can help with shedding.
