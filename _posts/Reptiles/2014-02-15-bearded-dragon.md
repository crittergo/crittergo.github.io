Bearded dragons are a fun, entertaining type of reptile to have as a pet, though they do require special equipment and some extra attention compared to many other types of reptiles. However, they are also fairly active, and are relatively easy to tame, making them enjoyable pets. 

##Shelter

Bearded dragons require fairly large tanks; a 40 gallon tank is the smallest acceptable size for a single beaded dragon, and if you have more than one, they should have a bigger tank. It’s also necessary to have a screen lid to cover the top of the lid. The cage should be lined with paper towels or paper, though sand, wood shavings, and similar products should be avoided, as the animal may eat them. The cage should also be complete with rocks and things to hide in. Most importantly, beaded dragons need exposure to heat lamps, and special UVA/UVB radiation lamps for reptiles can be purchased. 

##Diet

Bearded dragons should have water provided at all times. Their diet consists of both insects and vegetables. They typically eat crickets or mealworms, and younger bearded dragons should be fed more frequently, twice each day. Adults can be fed just once each day. Vegetables such as carrots, green beans, and peas can also be fed to bearded dragons .

##Activity/Exercise 

Bearded dragons can be handled regularly by their owners. Though they don’t need excessive regular attention, bearded dragons can be handled in order to give them extra activity. Some owners get leashes for bearded dragons so that they can explore without worry that they’ll get away. 

##Health

Bearded dragons may get dehydrated, so it’s important to keep water readily available. Bearded dragons with sunken eyes or wrinkled skin are likely dehydrated. Additional water or a diluted sports drink can be administered with an eye dropper if they initially refuse water. Bearded dragons also may 
experience droopy eyes, which is often caused by kidney problems. A bearded dragon with droopy eyes should see a vet right away for treatment. 

##Grooming

Though bearded dragons do not require extensive grooming, their nails may get long and extremely sharp. Owners can use a nail clipper and trip the tips of the nails, being careful not to trim too deeply. Nails should be trimmed no more than once every month.
