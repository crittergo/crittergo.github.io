Geckos make one of the easiest types of reptiles to have as a pet. There are many different breeds of geckos, though the leopard gecko is likely one of the most common and popular breeds.

##Shelter

Geckos should be kept in an terrarium. A 10 gallon terrarium is appropriate for one or two geckos, though larger terrariums can be used as well, and if you have more than two, you should strongly consider having a larger terrarium. The terrarium should also have a screen lid. The terrarium should have sand in the bottom, and be sure to use sand that is safe for animals; industrial sand or sand that contains a large amount of dust can be dangerous. Geckos will also need a heat lamp or heat pad of some sort, as they’re cold blooded. Be sure to also keep a few things in the terrarium for the gecko to hid under, such as a small cardboard box or a small plastic container.

##Diet

Geckos typically eat live prey, typically crickets or mealworms are used. Crickets are very nutritious, but you need to be careful to ensure they don’t get out. Mealworms are less likely to escape, and are easier to keep for a long amount of time. There are also various vitamins that can be given to geckos to add to the nutrition they’re getting.

##Activity/Exercise 

Geckos that are fed crickets are able to gain some additional activity, as crickets are more stimulating and can provide activity for the geckos when they feed. Otherwise, geckos do not need major additional exercise.

##Health

Do not grab a gecko by its tail, as it will lose its tail as a defense mechanism. The tail will grow back, but avoid this whenever possible. Geckos can also be susceptible to parasites and mites. Be sure to regularly clean their terrarium and get rid of any uneaten food on a regular basis.

##Grooming

Geckos do shed their skin, so this is something gecko owners need to be aware of. Young geckos will shed more frequently, and the gecko’s skin will turn dull and a white color right before shedding. At this time, it’s important to keep the terrarium moist to help with the shedding process. Be sure to keep a small portion of the terrarium moist, especially during the shedding process.
