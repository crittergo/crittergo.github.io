Gerbils are one of the most active and lovable small rodents that you can keep as a pet. That also means that they can be some of the most troublesome to keep in a cage. However, if you manage to give them a good home, then your gerbil can live for between three and four years.

## Shelter
Like other small rodents, gerbils are very social animals and you should at least consider keeping several of them together. However, it is a bad idea 
to keep males and females together because they will breed quickly. You can house gerbils in a wire cage or a glass aquarium. It needs to be kept away from direct light or cold air to avoid sickness.

## Diet

Gerbils tend to eat seeds as a main source of food. You can buy a pre-mixed blend of food at any pet store that will consist of seed, pellets, and dried vegetables. You can feed gerbils small amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables. Also, they enjoy sunflower seeds as a snack.

## Activity/Exercise
It is not advised to let your gerbils out of their cage and into the open unless you are absolutely sure that the area is escape proof. Gerbils are very frisky, and they can squeeze into small areas and become lost. Another great way to make sure that your gerbil gets exercise is by putting them in a small exercise ball and letting them loose around your home.

## Health

Most gerbils should be taken to a veterinarian once a year for examination. One of the biggest dangers facing gerbils is actually diarrhea and dehydration. This can be prevented by providing adequate water and fiber-rich foods.

## Grooming

As with any pet that is kept in a cage, you should change the bedding of your gerbilâ€™s habitat every week, with daily removal of droppings. It is important that your pets develop a sense of familiarity with you. This can be achieved by handling them safely, and often.
